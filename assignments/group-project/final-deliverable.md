# Group Project Final Deliverable

Refer to the [Group Project Description](/PROJECT.md).

## Description

Revise and expand initial system planning and analysis to include
 design and implementation considerations.

Write a detailed report
 which describes and documents your proposed information system solution. Reasonable submissions may contain over 40-50 pages of printed text and illustrations.

## Business Problem

Describe the nature of the business problem
 and the solution you chose as a result of considering a few different options.
 Describe why the chosen solution is the best choice.

## Information System Solution

Describe system objectives, functions, information requirements, and scope.
 Justify implementation of the system in terms of a cost-benefit analysis.
 Demonstrate in a "to-be" process diagram how the system simplifies the original "as-is" process.
 Describe any ways the system introduces efficiencies into the process. Describe the manner and methodology (e.g. Traditional/Waterfall vs Agile) by which the system will be developed, implemented, and adopted.

### System Components

Describe system components and any monetary costs that may apply for the acquisition or implementation or maintenance of each.

#### Users and Interface

Describe user and interface considerations. Who will use the system and who will maintain it?
  In what manner will users interact with the system?

#### Hardware

What hardware (e.g. personal computers, web servers, mobile phones, tablets, sensors, monitors, routers, etc.) does the system require?

#### Software

What software (e.g. proprietary applications, software as a service, etc.) will instruct system logic,
 and what operating systems and programming languages and frameworks, if any, are involved?

#### Networks

What networking and communications technologies and protocols (e.g. HTTP, SSH, FTP, SMTP, WiFi, Bluetooth, WAN, LAN, VPN, broadband, fiber, etc.) does the system require?

#### Datastore

How does the system capture and store data, and how does the system process data into information?
 What database technologies does the system use?
 What database concepts (e.g. Entities, Relationships, tables, datatypes, etc.) are included in the scope of the database design?

### Suggested Structure

Use the organizational structure

## Submission Instructions

Upload a .pdf file to [Blackboard](https://blackboard.gwu.edu/webapps/assignment/uploadAssignment?content_id=_6869960_1&course_id=_260292_1&assign_group_id=&mode=cpview) before the beginning of class.

## Evaluation Methodology

Each submission will be assigned an integer grade from 1 to 100 based on
 content,
 organizational structure,
 ability to address the requirements, and
 ability to address the business problem and provide value.
