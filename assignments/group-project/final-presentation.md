## Submission Instructions

Submit presentation .pdf to [Blackboard](https://blackboard.gwu.edu/webapps/assignment/uploadAssignment?content_id=_6869963_1&course_id=_260292_1&assign_group_id=&mode=cpview) before the beginning of class.

## Evaluation Methodology

Students, instructors, and possible guest judges will evaluate each presentation in terms of content and delivery. Students may not evaluate their own presentations.

Evaluators will assign each presentation an integer grade from 0 to 100.

Evaluations will be averaged to produce a single group grade for each presentation. This provides a baseline for the final grade.

Group grades will be compared, sorted, and ranked. Group rank may contribute to the final grade, as necessary.
