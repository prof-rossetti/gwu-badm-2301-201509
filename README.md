## Operations

### Teaching Methods

#### More Practice than Theory

This course calls for a required lab component to ensure students acquire relevant technical skills.

Emphasis will be placed on providing students with experiential and active learning opportunities.

Accordingly, instruction will more often take the form of lab sessions and support sessions than lecture sessions.

#### Accompanying Textbook

The following text book has been assigned to accompany this course:

title | author | edition | isbn | price range
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---

Relevant material from the textbook will be covered during lectures.

Students may optionally choose to purchase, borrow, or loan the book
 for a more in-depth experience.

### Evaluation Methods

There are no exams for this course.
 Student learning will be evaluated through the submission of assignments.

#### Assignments
